# Project: Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning!
Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s extremely busy world. People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.

The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual. These results are based on their profile, search/browsing history, what other people with similar traits/demographics are watching, and how likely are you to watch those movies. This is achieved through predictive modeling and heuristics with the data available.
## Key Features:
### Movie Recommendation:

1.Personalized Recommendations: Users can select a movie from a dropdown, and the app will recommend similar movies based on a pre-trained similarity model.
Poster Fetching: The app fetches and displays movie posters for the recommended movies using the TMDB API.

2.User Interface:
Dark Mode Theme: The app uses a dark background with a red and black color scheme, inspired by Netflix.
Styled Headers and Buttons: Headers and buttons are styled with custom CSS for a consistent and visually appealing UI.
Spacing and Layout: Proper spacing is maintained between UI elements for a clean and organized layout.

3.Data Handling:
Pickle File Loading: The app loads preprocessed movie data and similarity matrix from pickle files.
Error Handling: The app includes error handling to manage file loading issues gracefully.

4.API Integration:
TMDB API: The app integrates with the TMDB API to fetch movie posters, enhancing the visual appeal of the recommendations.

5.Responsive Layout:
Dynamic Columns: The recommended movies are displayed in a responsive layout using Streamlit's column functionality.
## Concept Used to Build the `model.pkl` File: Cosine Similarity

1. **Cosine Similarity** is a metric that measures the similarity between documents.
2. Vectors are required to demonstrate cosine similarity, which are represented as numpy arrays.
3. Use the `cosine_similarity()` function to calculate the similarity between two vectors.
4. The result is a value between [0, 1], where 0 means completely different and 1 means completely similar.

## Dataset Used:

## How to Run?

### STEPS:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/entbappy/Movie-Recommender-System-Using-Machine-Learning.git

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies. To create and activate a virtual environment, run:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install the Dependencies:**
   Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the Application:**

   With the dependencies installed, you can now run the Streamlit application. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   
5. **Access the Application:**

   Once the application is running, Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501) in your terminal. Open this URL in your web browser to interact with your Movie Recommender System.

   If you are running the application on a remote server or cloud service, make sure to use the appropriate URL provided by your hosting service.
